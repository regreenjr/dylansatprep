I'm going to generate the remaining questions in a more efficient format, then add them all at once.

This file is temporary - tracking question generation progress.

Target: 500 total questions (100 per category)
Current: ~50 total
Need: ~450 more

Strategy: Generate all questions in batches, then insert into questions.ts
